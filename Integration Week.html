<h2 style="color:rgba(95, 8, 8, 0.616)"><p>Meet Father Maximilien BOSSOU :</p></h2>

<center><img src="pere Max 1.jpg" width="330px"></center> 
<p>During our intergration week at Ucac-Icam, we were introduced to father  Maximielien BOSSOU, responsible for the management of the IT course at the institute.
  Father Max, as he is affectionately called, plays a pivotal role in shaping the educational journey of students at the university. 
  He encourges us to blend faith and engineering, emphasizing the Jesuit values that Ucac-Icam hols hear. 
  He frequently reminds us that being an engineer is also about acquiring knowledge responsible to serve others.
  His words inspire a deep sense of purpose and community among us as we embark on our studies.
  </p>
<p> As a catholique institution run by Jesuits, Ucac-Icac fosters an education that goes beyond 
  academic excellence. The values of Technical Competence, Human Responsability, and Spiritual growth 
are deeply ingrained in the student experience. I was impressed by how much emphasis is placed on not
only becomming a highly skilled engineer but also on developing into a responsible , ethical, and well-rounded individual.
I'll look forward to the comming months of learning, personal growth, and making a meaningful impact both
 inside and outside the classroom. </p>
